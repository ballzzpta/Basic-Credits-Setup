# Basic-Credits-Setup

This is a Basic setup for credits. All of the affiliate stuff is disabled inside the events section. Simply enable any of the ones you need enabled.

There's a section in the credits that allow you to do a special thanks to 2 people, if you need more than this, please create a file called friends.txt and place it inside the following path "C:/users/USERNAME/appdata/roaming/firebot/v5/overlay-resources/Credits". Add anyone else you want to thank inside that file. One person per line. Do Not leave a blank line at the end of the file.

Navigate to Preset Effects List and edit [Credits] Roll Credits effect. Enable line 15 to add the list to the credits.

If you would like to use an image during the credits, enable line 5 of the same effect. Place image inside the prior file path and name it image.png.

To edit the way it looks, inside the roll Credits effect, simply edit effect "Write to file (Build HTML File)". it's line 1. Navigate to the text box. Easiest way is to copy all text from text box, then edit text using any text editor that allows you to view HTML files.

If you don't want to thank anyone Please disable the 4 "Write to File" effects dealing with Special Thanks located inside [Credits] Roll Credits under preset effect lists.

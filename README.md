# Pop out this description for easier viewing of install
This is a Basic setup for credits. All of the affiliate stuff is disabled inside the events section. Simply enable any of the ones you need enabled.

Please head over to "%appdata%/roaming/firebot/v5/overlay-resources" and create a folder called "Credits"

There's a section in the credits that allow you to do a special thanks to 2 people, if you need more than this, please create a file called "friends.txt" and place it inside the folder you just created with one person per line. Do Not leave a blank line at the end of the file.

Navigate to Preset Effects List and edit [Credits] Roll Credits effect. Enable line 15 to add the list to the credits.

If you would like to use an image during the credits, enable line 5 of the same effect. Place image inside the credits folder and name it image.png. Recommended size of image should be 1250 x 877. Any taller and it won't display properly after rolling credits and any shorter can cause other text to appear on screen after done playing.

Colors selection
https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp go to this website to select the colors you would like to use. Only use the hex color codes

When selecting colors for your credits, please only use the HEX value. (#ffffff white) so only use the ffffff for the color.

If you don't want to thank anyone, please disable the 4 "Write to File" effects dealing with Special Thanks located inside [Credits] Roll Credits under preset effect lists.
